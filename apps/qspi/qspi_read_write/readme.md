# QSPI flash read write

This example shows how to use the QSPI Peripheral library to perform erase, write and read operation with the QSPI Serial Flash memory in Quad IO mode.

## Description

This example uses the QSPI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values to the QSPI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

The application can be configured to perform operations on below QSPI Serial Flash Memories
- SST26VF064B (Default)
- N25Q256

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the application project using its respective IDE
2. Open **app.h** file and set the macro for the QSPI Flash memory present on the board to 1
    ```
    #define APP_USE_SST26_FLASH     1

    #define APP_USE_N25Q_FLASH      0
    ```

4. Build and Program the application project
5. LED indicates success or failure:
    - LED is toggled when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash memory matches with the written value
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash did not match with the written value

The following table provides the LED name

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | -------- |
| [SAM E54 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)    | LED0 |
