# TRNG random number

This example shows how to use the TRNG Peripheral library to generate and read a random number.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the TRNG peripheral library to produce a 32-bit true random number. Generated random number can be used as an entropy source for seeding a Deterministic Random Number Generator (DRNG), creating cryptographic keys for ciphers etc.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_d5x_e5x) and click

![clone](../../../docs/images/clone.png)

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/trng/random_number/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

### Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and program the application using its IDE
4. The console displays the following message
