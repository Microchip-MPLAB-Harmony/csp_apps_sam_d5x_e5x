# NVMCTRL SmartEEPROM

This example application demonstrates how to use the SmartEEPROM feature in NVMCTRL PLIB to erase and program the internal Flash memory. 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit access is supported.

## Description

This SmartEEPROM feature is provided through the AHB2 interface and makes a portion of the NVM appear like a RAM. This example uses the NVMCTRL peripheral library to read or write a 8-bit data to the internal flash memory by using SmartEEPROM feature. This application demonstrates Read data from internal flash, Write data into internal flash. Along with these options,"Reset device" option also available in this demo to validate written data. This will be useful to check if EEPROM is holding user data even after reset.
