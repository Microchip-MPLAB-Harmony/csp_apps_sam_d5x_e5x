# SERCOM USART blocking

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral in USART mode to transfer block of data in a blocking manner.

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a USART in a blocking manner. The CPU polls the peripheral register continuously to manage the transfer. It receives a line of characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.
