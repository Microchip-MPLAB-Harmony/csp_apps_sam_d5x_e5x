# SERCOM I2C EEPROM read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM peripheral to write and read from the I2C serial EEPROM memory.

## Description

This example uses the I2C peripheral library to write an array of values to the I2C Serial EEPROM and verify the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Downloading and building the application

### Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

The following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| [SAM E54 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)    | LED0 |
