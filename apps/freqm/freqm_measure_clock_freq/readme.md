# FREQM measurement

This example application demonstrates how to use the FREQM peripheral to measure the frequency of the internal RC Oscillator.

## Description

The Frequency Meter (FREQM) can be used to accurately measure the frequency of a clock by comparing it to a known reference clock. The FREQM counts the number of periods of the measured clock with respect to the reference clock. This example application shows how to measure the cpu frequency using the 32-kHz Crystal oscillator as the reference clock.

## Downloading and building the application

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. Observe output message in console as follows:
